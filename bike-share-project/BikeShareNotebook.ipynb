    "Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/), a bike-share system provider for many major cities in the United States. You will compare the system usage between three large cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. You will also see if there are any differences within each system for those users that are registered, regular users and those users that are short-term, casual users."

    "## Posing Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "Before looking at the bike sharing data, you should start by asking questions you might want to understand about the bike share data. Consider, for example, if you were working for Motivate. What kinds of information would you want to know about in order to make smarter business decisions? If you were a user of the bike-share service, what factors might influence how you would want to use the service?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 1**: Write at least two questions related to bike sharing that you think could be answered by data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**: I want to ask 2 questions :\n",
    "\n",
    "1. How many trips got lost in between?\n",
    "2. Which station has the highest pickup?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: If you double click on this cell, you will see the text change so that all of the formatting is removed. This allows you to edit this block of text. This block of text is written using [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax), which is a way to format text using headers, links, italics, and many other options using a plain-text syntax.

    "Now it's time to collect and explore our data. In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in 2016 from our selected cities: New York City, Chicago, and Washington, DC. Each of these cities has a page where we can freely download the trip data.:\n",
    "\n",
    "- New York City (Citi Bike): [Link](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Chicago (Divvy): [Link](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data)\n",
    "- Washington, DC (Capital Bikeshare): [Link](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data)\n",
    "\n",
    "If you visit these pages, you will notice that each city has a different way of delivering its data. Chicago updates with new data twice a year, Washington DC is quarterly, and New York City is monthly. **However, you do not need to download the data yourself.** The data has already been collected for you in the `/data/` folder of the project files. While the original data for 2016 is spread among multiple files for each city, the files in the `/data/` folder collect all of the trip data for the year into one file per city. Some data wrangling of inconsistencies in timestamp format within each city has already been performed for you. In addition, a random 2% sample of the original data is taken to make the exploration more manageable. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2**: However, there is still a lot of data for us to investigate, so it's a good idea to start off by looking at one entry from each of the cities we're going to analyze. Run the first code cell below to load some packages and functions that you'll be using in your analysis. Then, complete the second code cell to print out the first trip recorded from each of the cities (the second line of each data file).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: You can run a code cell like you formatted Markdown cells above by clicking on the cell and using the keyboard shortcut **Shift** + **Enter** or **Shift** + **Return**. Alternatively, a code cell can be executed using the **Play** button in the toolbar after selecting it. While the cell is running, you will see an asterisk in the message to the left of the cell, i.e. `In [*]:`. The asterisk will change into a number to show that execution has completed, e.g. `In [1]`. If there is output, it will show up as `Out [1]:`, with an appropriate number to match the \"In\" number."

Use the start time of the trip to obtain these values. The New York City data includes the seconds in their timestamps, while Washington and Chicago do not. The [`datetime`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html) package will be very useful here to make the needed conversions.\n",

Washington divides its users into two types: 'Registered' for users with annual, monthly, and other longer-term subscriptions, and 'Casual', for users with 24-hour, 3-day, and other short-term passes. The New York and Chicago data uses 'Subscriber' and 'Customer' for these groups, respectively. For consistency, you will convert the Washington labels to match the other two.\n",

You have compared the relative volume of trips made between three U.S. cities and the ratio of trips made by Subscribers and Customers. For one of these cities, you have investigated differences between Subscribers and Customers in terms of how long a typical trip lasts. Now it is your turn to continue the exploration in a direction that you choose. Here are a few suggestions for questions to explore:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does ridership differ by month or season? Which month / season has the highest ridership? Does the ratio of Subscriber trips to Customer trips change depending on the month or season?\n",
    "- Is the pattern of ridership different on the weekends versus weekdays? On what days are Subscribers most likely to use the system? What about Customers? Does the average duration of rides change depending on the day of the week?\n",

    "If any of the questions you posed in your answer to question 1 align with the bullet points above, this is a good opportunity to investigate one of them. As part of your investigation, you will need to create a visualization. If you want to create something other than a histogram, then you might want to consult the [Pyplot documentation](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/pyplot_summary.html). In particular, if you are plotting values across a categorical variable (e.g. city, user type), a bar chart will be useful. The [documentation page for `.bar()`](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.bar.html#matplotlib.pyplot.bar) includes links at the bottom of the page with examples for you to build off of for your own use.\n",

There are also a lot of potential analyses that could be performed on the data which are not possible with only the data provided. For example, detailed location data has not been investigated. Where are the most commonly used docks? What are the most common routes? As another example, weather has potential to have a large impact on daily ridership. How much is ridership impacted when there is rain or snow? Are subscribers or customers affected more by changes in weather?\n",
