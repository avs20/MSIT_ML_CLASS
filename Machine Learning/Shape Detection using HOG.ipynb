    "\n",
    "\n",
    "why we have divided the image into 8×8 cells. One of the important reasons to use a feature descriptor to describe a patch of an image is that it provides a compact representation. An 8×8 image patch contains 8x8x3 = 192 pixel values. The gradient of this patch contains 2 values ( magnitude and direction ) per pixel which adds up to 8x8x2 = 128 numbers. By the end of this section we will see how these 128 numbers are represented using a 9-bin histogram which can be stored as an array of 9 numbers. Not only is the representation more compact, calculating a histogram over a patch makes this represenation more robust to noise. Individual graidents may have noise, but a histogram over 8×8 patch makes the representation much less sensitive to noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "But why 8×8 patch ? Why not 32×32 ? It is a design choice informed by the scale of features we are looking for. HOG was used for pedestrian detection initially. 8×8 cells in a photo of a pedestrian scaled to 64×128 are big enough to capture interesting features ( e.g. the face, the top of the head etc. ).\n",
    "\n",
    "The histogram is essentially a vector ( or an array ) of 9 bins ( numbers ) corresponding to angles 0, 20, 40, 60 … 160.\n",

    "Let us look at one 8×8 patch in the image and see how the gradients look.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On the right, we see the raw numbers representing the gradients in the 8×8 cells with one minor difference — the angles are between 0 and 180 degrees instead of 0 to 360 degrees. These are called “unsigned” gradients because a gradient and it’s negative are represented by the same numbers. In other words, a gradient arrow and the one 180 degrees opposite to it are considered the same. But, why not use the 0 – 360 degrees ? Empirically it has been shown that unsigned gradients work better than signed gradients for pedestrian detection."

    "The following figure illustrates the process. We are looking at magnitude and direction of the gradient of the same 8×8 patch as in the previous figure. A bin is selected based on the direction, and the vote ( the value that goes into the bin ) is selected based on the magnitude. Let’s first focus on the pixel encircled in blue. It has an angle ( direction ) of 80 degrees and magnitude of 2. So it adds 2 to the 5th bin. The gradient at the pixel encircled using red has an angle of 10 degrees and magnitude of 4. Since 10 degrees is half way between 0 and 20, the vote by the pixel splits evenly into the two bins.\n",

If you make the image darker by dividing all pixel values by 2, the gradient magnitude will change by half, and therefore the histogram values will change by half. Ideally, we want our descriptor to be independent of lighting variations. In other words, we would like to “normalize” the histogram so they are not affected by lighting variations.\n",

It is not a bad idea, but a better idea is to normalize over a bigger sized block of 16×16. A 16×16 block has 4 histograms which can be concatenated to form a 36 x 1 element vector and it can be normalized just the way a 3×1 vector is normalized. The window is then moved by 8 pixels ( see animation ) and a normalized 36×1 vector is calculated over this window and the process is repeated."
